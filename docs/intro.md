# Getting Started

React Chat Elements UI pack was developed by **Detaysoft** for the purpose of developing useful chat applications. You just need to do a few steps to use this awesome package in your project.

## Install
```bash
npm install react-chat-elements --save
```
or you can use **yarn**
```bash
yarn add react-chat-elements
```

We have completed installing the package.

## Import

First of all we need to import style file for our package.

```jsx
import "react-chat-elements/dist/main.css"
```

Then here is an example usage for importing components,

```jsx
import { MessageBox } from "react-chat-elements";
```

## Congratulations !

That's all, now let's choose a component and use it !
